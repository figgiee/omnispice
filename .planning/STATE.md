# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** Students can simulate circuits accurately in a modern, intuitive interface that helps them understand circuits — not just compute them.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core Simulator

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Core Simulator)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-09 — Roadmap created; v1 requirements mapped to phases 1-2, v2 requirements to phases 3-5

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Research]: React Flow chosen over tldraw — tldraw requires $6,000/yr commercial license; React Flow is MIT
- [Research]: No SharedArrayBuffer anywhere — single-threaded ngspice in Web Worker to avoid COOP/COEP headers breaking LMS embeds
- [Research]: ngspice pipe-mode vs shared-library API unresolved — must spike in Phase 1 week 1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: ngspice WASM build reproducibility with ngspice 45.x + current Emscripten — unvalidated, budget 1-2 week spike
- [Phase 1]: React Flow orthogonal wire routing with T-junctions — needs proof-of-concept before full schematic editor build
- [Phase 2]: Clerk SSO/SAML pricing for university IdPs — verify before Phase 2 implementation begins
